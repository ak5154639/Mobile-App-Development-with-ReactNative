# Javascript is Interpreted
  - Each browser has its own JavaScript engine, which either interprets, or uses lazy compilation
  - Some interpreters with browsers are:
    - V8: Chrome and Node.js
    - SpiderMonkey: Firefox
    - JavaScriptCore: Safari
    - Chakra: Microsoft Edge/IE
  - They each implement the ECMAScript standard, but may differ for anything not defined by the standard

# Syntax
  ```
  const firstName = "Aniket"    //semicolons can be omiited
  const lastName = "Sharma";
  const arr = ["student", 24, true, function(){
  console.log('hi')}
  ];
  
  // Comment
  for (let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
    console.log(arr[i]);
  }
  ```

# Types
  - Dynamic typing
  - Primitive types (no methods, immutable)
      - undefined(absence of value) - on declaring any variable, JS automatically assigns is undefined
      - null(absence of value) - when we explicitly assign value
      - boolean
      - number
      - string
      - (symbol)
  - Objects

<details>
  <summary><strong>Bug</strong> On consoling <code>typeof(null)</code> we will get <code>Object</code> as ouput</summary>

  The reason why `typeof null` returns `"object"` in JavaScript is considered a historical quirk and is often considered a mistake or an oversight in the language's design.

When JavaScript was created, its initial implementation had a tagging system for its values. Each value in JavaScript had a tag that indicated its type. The tag for objects was `0x1`, and `null` was represented by the value `0x1` with the least significant bit set to 0, which effectively means it was a special kind of object. However, this doesn't mean that `null` is actually an object; it's a primitive value with its own unique characteristics.

Due to this historical reason, when you use `typeof null`, JavaScript returns `"object"`. This behavior persists for compatibility reasons, as changing it could potentially break existing code that relies on this behavior.

So, while `null` is not an object in the usual sense (it's a primitive value representing the absence of any object value), the `typeof` operator returning `"object"` for `null` is a result of JavaScript's historical design choices.

# Typecasting
  - Explicit vs Implicit coercion
      ```
      const x = 42;
      const explicit = String(x);      // explicit === "42"
      const implicit = x + "";          // implicit === "42"
      ```
  - == vs ===
      - == coerces the types
      - === requires equivalent types
  ### Examples
  ```
    console.log(typeof(string));
    console.log("42" === 42);
    console.log(42 === 42);
  ```

  > In Javascript arrays, functions and objects all are objects.

# Primitives vs Objects
  - Primitives are immutable
  - Objects are mutable and stored by reference
    #### Three methods to create objects:
    ```
    // METHOD 1
    const  o = new Object()
    o.firstName = "Aniket"
    o.lastName = 'Sharma'
    o.isStudent = true
    o.greet = function() {
        console.log("hi")
    }

    // METHOD 2
    const o2 = {}
    o2.firstName = "Aditya"
    o2['lastName'] = "Sharma"
    const key = "isStudent"
    o2[key] = true
    o2['greet'] = function() {
        console.log("hello")
    }

    // METHOD 3
    const o3 = {
        1 : "test"    //keys can be numbers and implicitly casted to string as "1"
        firstName : "Samar",
        lastName : "Bisht",
        isStudent : true,
        greet : function() {
            console.log("HI")
        },
        address : {     //objects can be nested
            houseNumber: 2123,
            street: 72,
            area: "NIT Faridabad"
        }
    }
    ```
